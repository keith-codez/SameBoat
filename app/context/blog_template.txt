- slug
- cover
- author
- category
- blocks:
    - excerpt
    - content
    - tags
    - readingTime
    - featured

Follow a structured flow:
1. Introduce the FAQ question and answer.
2. Include context information provided in the /context folder.
3. Use the tone specified in ANCHOR.txt.
4. Suggest relevant tags from the predefined list:
   about, getting-started, features, community, privacy, pricing, partnerships, mission.

Ensure the output is ready to save in Markdown or JSON for Strapi.
